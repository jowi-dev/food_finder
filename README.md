# FoodFinder 

## Description
This is a small CLI based application that will randomly generate a place to eat from a CSV.

Given that this is an application targeted at developers, a CLI felt like the most appropriate place to land with it 
being the intersection between lowest time to implement, and one of the most uniquely developer experiences on a computer.

## MVP Roadmap
- [x] setup CSV ingestion
- [x] select truck from list 
- [x] output truck to user

## Additional Features
- [x] add better prompting for a richer CLI experience
- [ ] allow for category selection 
- [ ] add selection to a list so we know what has been selected


## Running the Project
This project was built with elixir 1.16, so that will need to be installed. Apart from that, a simple `mix deps.get` and `mix run`
